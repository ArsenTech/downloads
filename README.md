# ArsenTech's File Collection
Welcome to **ArsenTech's File Collection for Downloads Page**! Here, you can explore a variety of files, software, updates, and utilities that are available for download. We've moved everything over to GitHub because Firebase has switched to a paid storage plan.

## About This Collection
This repository is packed with a diverse range of files, neatly sorted by type and category. You’ll find software, updates, and legacy tools tailored for various platforms. Best of all, everything is available for free download and organized for your convenience.

With Firebase recently moving to a paid storage model, I’ve taken the step to migrate all files to GitHub, ensuring that you can still access these resources at no cost.

So go ahead, dive in, and grab the files that fit your needs!

## File Formats
Files in this collection are available in **Zip** and **7z** formats. 
- **Zip files** are compatible with most operating systems and software.
- **7z files** offer better compression and are typically smaller but require compatible software like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) for extraction.

## Why GitHub?
I used to host my files on Firebase, which was great because it was free. However, Firebase Storage has now switched to a paid plan. To keep these resources available to you at no charge, I've moved everything over to GitHub.

GitHub is a solid choice for free hosting of public repositories, and I've made sure the files are neatly organized for easy downloading. Enjoy!
