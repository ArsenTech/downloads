# ArsenTech's File Collection
Welcome to **ArsenTech's File Collection for Downloads Page**! Here, you can explore a variety of files, software, updates, and utilities that are available for download. We've moved everything over to GitHub because Firebase has switched to a paid storage plan.

## About This Collection
This repository is packed with a diverse range of files, neatly sorted by type and category. You’ll find software, updates, and legacy tools tailored for various platforms. Best of all, everything is available for free download and organized for your convenience.

With Firebase recently moving to a paid storage model, I’ve taken the step to migrate all files to GitHub, ensuring that you can still access these resources at no cost.

So go ahead, dive in, and grab the files that fit your needs!

## File Formats
Files in this collection are available in **Zip** and **7z** formats. 
- **Zip files** are compatible with most operating systems and software.
- **7z files** offer better compression and are typically smaller but require compatible software like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) for extraction.

## Why GitHub?
I used to host my files on Firebase, which was great because it was free. However, Firebase Storage has now switched to a paid plan. To keep these resources available to you at no charge, I've moved everything over to GitHub.

GitHub is a solid choice for free hosting of public repositories, and I've made sure the files are neatly organized for easy downloading. Enjoy!

## Download Information
Some Windows versions are hosted here for convenience, while others are linked to official sources since they are too big or due to licensing restrictions. This is the split:

#### **Direct Downloads (Hosted in Repository)**
- **Windows 95**
- **Windows 98**
- **Windows 2000**
- **Windows ME**
- **Windows XP**

These legacy systems are provided directly for download here. You can download them directly without being redirected.
#### **Official Sources**
- **Windows Vista** (Internet Archive)
- **Windows 7** (Internet Archive)
- **Windows 8.1** (Internet Archive)
- **Windows 10**
- **Windows 11**

Due to their huge sizes and official licensing schemes, those versions are linked to the official download pages of each of them. If you click the download link, it will navigate you to the official website of those versions.
### Why This Approach?
- **Space Requirement**: Some operating systems like Windows Vista and above take lots of space, and hosting them directly on the repository would infringe on GitHub file size policies.
- **Official Sources Only**: To ascertain compatibility and also so you can always get the latest release, we provide direct links to official sources for newly added operating systems. This also installs you with the safest, genuine version of the OS.

We advise installing these older operating systems with caution since they are no longer supported by Microsoft and can put one at risk of security vulnerabilities. It is always best to test them first in a safe environment, such as a virtual machine.
