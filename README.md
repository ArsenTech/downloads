#### Do You Provide Malware Downloads
No. I Won't Provide Malware Downloads Because It Can Infect Someone's PC and It is Unethical. I don't want to Share Some Malware with Someone Just For Their Safety.

#### Why Did You Remove Windows Vista - 11 Versions?
Due to space limitations, I’ve removed the Windows Vista - 11 versions from this collection. Instead, I’ve linked to the official sources for these versions to ensure that you’re getting the most authentic and up-to-date files directly from the provider. Some versions are linked from the Internet Archive. While we strive to provide reliable sources, please verify file integrity before use.

#### Why don't you display file sizes and dates for the downloads anymore?
Due to changes in storage methods (from Firebase to GitHub) and Github API limitations, I am unable to display the file sizes and creation dates on the website. However, you can see the file size by downloading the file to your device. Once downloaded, the file size is readily available through your computer's file explorer. If you require the file size of any specific file, don't hesitate to contact me, and I will be happy to share it!
